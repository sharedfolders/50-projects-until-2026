# A little pause
I quickly realised that, for my projects to be interesting, i lacked a lot of knowledge.
I will finish my full stack course, and i'll come back !

For the moment, i'll archive the 3 projects i did so far ! 

See ya :)

# [ARCHIVED] 50 projects until 2026

Welcome ! To boost my productivity (and to learn new stuff), i decided to challenge myself : **build 50 projects until 2026**.

Each repo has it's own README, where i introspect the stuff i could've done better, the stuff i could implement later, and more !!
